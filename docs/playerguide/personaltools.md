The framework contains some small scripts that add a few useful functions that you can use in different situations. Get yourself acquainted with them to maximise your experience!


## Grasscutter

You are equipped with a grasscutter tool that will allow you to clear/flatten a small patch of grass in front of you. This is very useful when your perfect firing position has its line-of-sight is blocked by a wall of grass.

To use the grass cutter, Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Win</kbd> to open the ACE Self-Interaction menu. Got to `Equipment >> Grasscutter`.


## Earplugs

You are equipped with a set of virtual earplugs that will lower sound by 90% whilst they are equipped. Useful for long, loud helicopter rides.

To use the Earplugs, use the scroll wheel and select Insert Earplugs. To remove them, follow the same instructions but select the Remove Earplugs action.

Voices via TFAR/ACRE are not affected by this volume reduction so you can still hear teammates properly.
