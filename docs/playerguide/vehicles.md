Vehicles are a obviously a staple of the combined-arms charm of Arma 3. As such, you may find usable vehicles in a mission.

Unless told otherwise, vehicles are free to use by any role on the team, though usually its good practice to try and designate crewmen/pilots individually and give them priority.



## Garage

The framework contains a Garage system that may be enabled by your mission-maker:

- The Garage is where you can spawn in fresh vehicles
- The vehicles can be infinitely spawnable, or have spawn limits put on them by the mission-maker
- Once spawned, a vehicle cannot be placed back in the Garage, so think wisely!
