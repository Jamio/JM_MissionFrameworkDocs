The Framework contains a nicely organised custom briefing setup. This is designed to allowed mission-makers to give you more information about the scope of the mission.

You can access it by opening your map, and entering the briefing tab.

It is recommended that you give this a decent read at the beginning of the mission, as it can often contain useful information like OPFOR strength, civilian prsence, your ROE, and information about your options for vehicles, resupply and reinsertion.
