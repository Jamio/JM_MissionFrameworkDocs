Welcome to the Player Guide for the JM Mission Framework.

This section covers everything you need to know as a player in a mission that utilises this framework.

You don't need to know any scripting or mission-making, and if you ONLY plan on playing, you can skip everything else on this site beyond this section!


## Feedback

If you play in any of the missions used with this framework, and have ideas/suggestions/feedback, please leave it in this form:

[Feedback Form]([https://just-the-docs.com](https://forms.gle/ojcDJg9jcSjy14Sq9)){: .btn .btn-green }

Any feedback is welcome!
