# DLC

As we all know, Arma 3 has a bunch of DLC both small and large. The game will, for some of the DLCs, let you join the server even if you don't own some of the DLC being used in the mission.

There are also mods that use DLC models as a base, for things like retexturing. In a lot of cases, these mods don't show you that they require DLC, until you use them without owning the required DLC.

This can be very annoying as you are assaulted with watermarks while you play.

## DLC Checker

To try and avoid this, the framework contains a script that is designed to tell both the mission-maker during editing, and you the player when you join the game, whether you are using gear that requires a DLC.

When you join the mission, your gear will be checked for DLC and ownership. If you don't own the DLC required for gear you are using, you will recieve a small pop-up asking you to notify the Zeus.

If possible, try and make a note of what it is that needs changing in your loadout so that Zeus can easily fix it.

{: .info }
The mission-maker should have already notified you of any slots that require optional DLC. But this check when you start the mission acts as a bit of a backup.
