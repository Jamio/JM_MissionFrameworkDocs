# TFAR Basics

In missions using Task Force Arrowhead Radio (TFAR), your voice and radio comms are simulated for immersion and realism. 

This section explains how radios work, what each one does, and how to use them effectively.


## Short-Range vs Long-Range Radios

> Short-Range Radios
> - Used for intra-squad communciation
> - Range of 500m - 5km
> - ~16 Channels
> - Examples: PRC-343, PRC-152


> Long-Range Radios
> - Used for communication between squads, with pilots, Command, or across larger distances.
> - Range of 5km - 20km
> - ~100+ Channels
> - Examples: PRC-117F


## Using Your Radio

Make sure that you have a radio equipped, either in your radio slot (SR) or as a backpack (LR).

Use the `ACE Self-Interaction Menu >> Radios >> (your radio) >> Open` or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open your radio.

You will be brought to a radio interface. I will show you an example using the PRC-152. The layout of your radio may look different, but the functionality will be the same, just hover over the buttons to see what they do:
