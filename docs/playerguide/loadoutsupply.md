# Loadouts

The Framework contains two different methods for you to be kitted out with your gear.

## Mission Loadout

The first method is the manual setup of your loadout by the mission-maker.

The mission-maker will setup your weaponry, equipment and inventory. You may be given boxes that will give you access to extra items, but this is at the mission-makers discretion.

With this method, your input is limited, but it is good practice to go through your loadout on mission start and communicate with your team as to what you've got!


## Role-Restricted Arsenal

The second method is an ACE arsenal that is restricted based on your role.

The mission-maker will setup a list of common AND role-specific items. Common items will be available to every role, whilst role-specific will be available to that role only.

For instance, a medic might have the only access to blood-bags, or an ammo-bearer might get a larger backpack.

With this method, it is up to you to create your loadout in the arsenal from the ground up. Whatever you exit the arsenal menu with will be your respawn loadout for the mission<sup>⚙️</sup>.

Important things to remember with this are radios, map, compass, watch, magazines for your weapons!


# Resupply

Resupply inventory is automatically generated based on what gear you start or what gear is available to you in the role-restricted arsenal.

The mission-maker will decide the size of the resupply inventory.

The framework includes a resupply Box Spawner that can be enabled by the mission-maker. This will allow you to spawn your own crates for resupply. Resupply crates may also be given to you in limited amounts at mission start, or provided by zeus upon request/at set points in the mission.

The Box Spawner<sup>⚙️</sup> can be used to spawn resupply crates, including ammo crates, medical crates, csw crates, engineering crates and custom, mission-specific crates.

Because of the way that the resupply system works, it is highly recommended that you stick with your original loadout weapons, or <i>at least</i> the weapons of your squad. If you pick up an enemy rifle mid-mission, there is a good chance that you will not be able to rearm at the resupply points like everyone else.
