ACE is a staple of 99% of our missions.

It adds plenty of new features to the game, most of which we make full use of. There's a lot to get your head around when approaching ACE for the first time, but
there are several things you can tweak to make things more manageable.

## Interaction Menu

ACE has its own interaction system, and nearly everything related to ACE revolves around this system.

To interact with objects in front of you, press and hold the windows key. To interact with yourself, hold Ctrl + Windows Key.

From this menu, you can select an option by highlighting it and releasing the menu.

A lot of vanilla interactions are replaced by ACE, so if youre having issues with something, try using the ACE interaction menu first.

## Rebinding Grenades

Because of how close the default medical menu keybind ("H") is to the grenade throw keybind ("G") - there is a high probability of you sausage-fingering the grenade button,
and killing everyone around you. A quick fix is to rebind the grenade throw:

In-game, go to ```Options >> Controls >> Weapons``` then edit ```Throw``` and set it to 2x "G" presses. Press OK to save your changes.

## Static Interaction Menus

Unless told otherwise, vehicles are free to use by any role on the team, though usually its good practice to try and designate crewmen/pilots individually and give them priority.



## Garage

The framework contains a Garage system that may be enabled by your mission-maker:

- The Garage is where you can spawn in fresh vehicles
- The vehicles can be infinitely spawnable, or have spawn limits put on them by the mission-maker
- Once spawned, a vehicle cannot be placed back in the Garage, so think wisely!
