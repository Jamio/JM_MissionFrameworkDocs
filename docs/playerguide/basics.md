## What to expect

Our missions are designed to be semi-realistic, but not compromise on fun. We expect everyone to communicate, and work as a team to complete objectives.

There is room for plenty of fun and messing around, but at the end of the day, the real enjoyement comes from playing together and working efficiently.

We play a range of missions, from sneaky spec ops infilitrations, hostage rescues and sabotage to all-out armoured assaults, combined arms and lots of good gunfights.

As long as you are prepared to listen, and contribute to the team, that is enough.


## How to play

### Roles

The roles that are present in any given mission are decided by the mission-maker.

Sometimes, these roles will be given before the mission date. In this case, its a first-come-first-served system where you must volunteer to take a specific role in advance.

Most times though, you won't get to pick roles until the mission lobby. There are no restrictions on who can take what - we all try and work together to ensure that people get to experience a bit of everything they want to.


### Communication

We use TFAR for immersive in-game communications.

With TFAR, you can speak locally to people nearby, but also across radio channels at short and long distances.

Making sure you understand how TFAR works, the keybinds, the things you need to remember to turn on/off is essential to getting started.

Check the TFAR guide on this site if you need a refresher about TFAR.


### Gameplay

The way that a mission is structured can vary depending on the specific mission, but there are some elements that are pretty consistent.

Firstly, we usually play in squads. These can contain anywhere from 3-9 people at any time. In a squad, you are expected to listen to your Squad Leader and stick with your teammates. Lone wolves often get left behind unintentionally or lost on the battlefield, forcing Zeus to deal with them separately. Communicate properly, check on your teammates, call for medics, pull security and you will have plenty of fun in the meantime.

Secondly, being involved in the game should be your priority. If you want to take a bit of a backseat, that is fine, we are a casual group. However, not engaging with the mission, not assisting your teammates and not fulfilling your role is detrimental to everyone you're playing with and will only sour the experience.

Finally, there is an expectation that you kind of know what you're doing when it comes to the basic systems of the game. Things can get quite complex betwen TFAR, ACE and all manner of other stuff going on, especially when shit hits the fan. However, people having to hold your hand mid-game because you don't know how to rebind a key or use your short-range radio is not fun for anyone. Brush up before you play so we can minimise this as much as possible!


## Final Words

At the end of the day, these missions are supposed to be engaging, immersive and good fun for everyone. We don't have any particularly strict rules regarding how our missions run, but having 10-15 people being active in wanting to play helps the experience so much. It provides mission-makers with motivation to continue building, and gives the players dependable, enthusiastic people to play with. Its a win-win.
