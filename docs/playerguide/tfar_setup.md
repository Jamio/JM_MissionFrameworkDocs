# Installation

To get set up with TFAR/Teamspeak you will need to do the following:

- Step 1: Install the Teamspeak 3 Client from [the Teamspeak website]([https://teamspeak.com/en/downloads/](https://teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#ts3client))

{: .warning }
Make sure you download Teamspeak 3, not Teamspeak 6. The link should take you the download page for 3, but be wary just in case. Teamspeak 6 does not support plugins yet, so TFAR is incompatible with it. 

- Step 2: If you haven't already, install the Task Force Arrowhead Radio (Beta!!!) mod for Arma 3.

- Step 3: Open your steam library, right click on Arma 3 and select browse local files. In your arma folder open the "!workshop" folder. Find the <b>@Task Force Arrowhead Radio</b> mod folder and open it. Open the "teamspeak" folder and double click on the teamspeak addon - this should install it for you.

- Step 4: Thats it! When we play Arma using TFAR we will need to load up teamspeak and join the server (details are in discord)
