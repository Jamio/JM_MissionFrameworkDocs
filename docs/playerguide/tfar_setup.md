# Installation

To get set up with TFAR/Teamspeak you will need to do the following:

> Step 1: Install the Teamspeak 3 Client from [the Teamspeak website](https://teamspeak.com/en/downloads/)

> Step 2: If you haven't already, install the Task Force Arrowhead Radio (Beta!!!) mod for Arma 3.

> Step 3: Open your steam library, right click on Arma 3 and select browse local files. In your arma folder open the "!workshop" folder. Find the <b>@Task Force Arrowhead Radio</b> mod folder and open it. Open the "teamspeak" folder and double click on the teamspeak addon - this should install it for you.

> Step 4: Thats it! When we play Arma using TFAR we will need to load up teamspeak and join the server (details are in discord)
