The framework uses a centralised respawning system - meaning that you will always respawn at a fixed location - typically a FOB or Staging Area. 

This is designed to keep respawns immersive and cohesive, whilst giving maximum flexibility in options to redeploy into the fight.

## Respawn Area

When you respawn, you will appear at the designated Respawn Area. From here, you can:

- Reorganise and wait for teammates
- Resupply<sup>⚙️</sup>
- Choose how to **redeploy** into the action

At the respawn area, you will find an object labelled <b>"Deployment Station"</b> - this is what is used to access reinsertion options.

## Reinsertion Options

Depending on the mission, you may see one or more of the following redeployment methods:

### 🚩 <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Rally Point</span>

If your squad or team has an active rally point:

- You will be able to teleport directly to it
- If enemies are too close, the rally may be disabled
- Rally points are placed by designated Squad Leaders or any Team Leader


### 🪖 <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Squadmate Teleport</span>

You may have the option to teleport directly to a living squadmate:

- This option is usually limited, as its very arcade-y
- You can teleport to squadmates even if they are under heavy fire, so this carries an extreme risk!

This method can be useful if your squad is scattered, but holding a safe position.



### 🚁 <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Request Reinsert</span>

If neither a rally nor a safe squadmate is available:

- You can request a pickup from pilots or transport vehicles
- This will send a global alert to all players that someone requires a pick-up
- You may need to wait until a ride becomes available. This may be AI, or (hopefully) player-controlled


## 🧾 Summary Table

| Option            | How It Works                        | Limits / Conditions                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rally Point       | Teleport to active rally point       | Requires coordination with team/placement of rally points        |
| Squadmate Teleport    | Teleport to friendly player  | No checks on nearby enemies - risky!           |
| Pickup Request    | Sends alert to pilots or logistics  | Requires human or AI response      |


### Tips

- Don't rush to reinsert - if possible take time to rearm and regroup. It's easy to rush back onto a rally that is under very heavy fire, and die quickly.
- Check your map, use long-range radios (or a boosted short-range) to coordinate with you teammates - where are you really needed?

## Final Thoughts

The goal of this system is to make respawning feel intentional and immersive - more like being deliberately deployed as reinforcements, rather than just spawning onto the same team spawn on the frontline, no matter the situation. 



## 💀 Unconsciousness & Spectator View

If you're critically wounded:
- You'll enter an **unconscious state** where you can’t move or speak
- You may hear muffled audio or a “heartbeat” effect
- If **not revived**, you'll **bleed out** and either die or become a spectator

While spectating:
- You may only see your body, or a limited first-person view
- You may receive messages or sound cues from the framework
- You won’t be able to interact or reveal enemy positions

---

## 🪖 Rally System

Rally points act as **team respawn hubs** placed by squad leaders or medics.

- A rally flag will appear in the field (often with a smoke marker)
- You can respawn here if it’s active
- If enemies get too close, the rally will **collapse**
- Rallies often have **limited respawns or cooldowns**

> Stick with your team and communicate — your rally may be the only way back to the front line!


---

## 🎧 Earplugs

You can insert/remove earplugs via:
- The **ACE self-interaction menu**
- Or a bound key (if enabled in mission settings)

Earplugs:
- Reduce loud gunfire and explosion volume
- Help you stay aware during prolonged firefights
- Can be toggled on/off at any time

---

## 📦 Supply Crates

You’ll find ammo, grenades, and equipment in marked supply crates.

- Crates may be static, vehicle-based, or spawned by the mission
- Crates are categorized by type (e.g., **Ammo**, **Medical**)
- Contents are dynamically generated based on the mission’s needs

---

## 🩹 Medical Stations

Some missions include **medical stations** that:
- Heal unconscious players
- Replenish your medical supplies
- Act as safe respawn points

Look for tents, boxes, or medic-marked vehicles.

## ✅ Framework Behavior Tips

- The framework **does not interfere with core ACE mechanics**, but may modify respawn/spectator behavior
- Some missions may include **custom sound cues, visual effects**, or messages via the framework
- When in doubt, ask your squad leader — they may have additional tools available via framework systems

---

## 🧭 Final Advice

Play like you’re part of the world:
- Use your tools, listen to cues, and rely on your squad
- Not every death is final — but every decision matters

Have fun, fight smart, and enjoy the mission!
