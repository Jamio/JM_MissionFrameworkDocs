The framework uses a centralised respawning system - meaning that you will always respawn at a fixed location - typically a FOB or Staging Area. 

This is designed to keep respawns immersive and cohesive, whilst giving maximum flexibility in options to redeploy into the fight.

## Respawn Area

When you respawn, you will appear at the designated Respawn Area. From here, you can:

- Reorganise and wait for teammates
- Resupply<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup>
- Choose how to **redeploy** into the action

At the respawn area, you will find an object labelled <b>"Deployment Station"</b> - this is what is used to access reinsertion options.

## Reinsertion Options

Depending on the mission, you may see one or more of the following redeployment methods:

### üö© <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Rally Point</span>

If your squad or team has an active rally point:

- You will be able to teleport directly to it
- If enemies are too close, the rally may be disabled
- Squad Rally Points are placed by any eligible team leader
- Platoon Rally Points are placed only be designated Platoon Leaders


### ü™ñ <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Squadmate Teleport</span>

You may have the option to teleport directly to a living squadmate:

- This option is usually limited, as its very arcade-y
- If enemies are too close to the chosen squadmate, the teleport may be disabled

This method can be useful if your squad is scattered, but holding a safe position.



### üöÅ <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Request Reinsert</span>

If neither a rally nor a safe squadmate is available:

- You can request a pickup from pilots or transport vehicles
- This will send a global alert to all players that someone requires a pick-up
- You may need to wait until a ride becomes available. This may be AI, or (hopefully) player-controlled


## üßæ Summary Table

| Option            | How It Works                        | Limits / Conditions                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rally Point       | Teleport to active rally point       | Requires coordination with team/placement of rally points + will be blocked by enemy presence        |
| Squadmate Teleport    | Teleport to friendly player  | Will be blocked by enemy presence           |
| Pickup Request    | Sends alert to pilots or logistics  | Requires human or AI response      |


### Tips

- Don't rush to reinsert - if possible take time to rearm and regroup. It's easy to rush back onto a rally that is under very heavy fire, and die quickly.
- Check your map, use long-range radios (or a boosted short-range) to coordinate with you teammates - where are you really needed?

## Final Thoughts

The goal of this system is to make respawning feel intentional and immersive - more like being deliberately deployed as reinforcements, rather than just spawning onto the same team spawn on the frontline, no matter the situation.
