# 🎮 Player Guide

Welcome to **Mission Framework** player guide.  
This page explains how the framework’s systems function during gameplay, so you know what to expect when playing a mission that uses it.

The framework contains several features that may be turned on or off depending on the mission. For the sake of not having to repeat "this will depend on settings" after every sentence - bear that in mind for now.

# 🔁 Respawning and Reinsertion

The framework uses a centralised respawning system - meaning that you will always respawn at a fixed location - typically a FOB or Staging Area. This is designed to give maximum flexibility in options to redeploy into the fight.

## Respawn Area



At the respawn area, you will find an object labelled <b>"Deployment Station"</b>. This is where all of your options to get back into the fight will be displayed.

## 🚩 Rally System

The rally system allows your team to place down points for people to redeploy onto from the "spawn zone

If you die, you may:
- Respawn at the designated spawn zone
- Enter spectator mode while awaiting respawn if **permadeath** is enabled


### Reinsertion

There are three ways in which you may be able to get back into the fight after you respawn.

1. <font color="green">Rally System</font> - As part of the mission, you may be able to place rallies. Platoon Rally

## 💀 Unconsciousness & Spectator View

If you're critically wounded:
- You'll enter an **unconscious state** where you can’t move or speak
- You may hear muffled audio or a “heartbeat” effect
- If **not revived**, you'll **bleed out** and either die or become a spectator

While spectating:
- You may only see your body, or a limited first-person view
- You may receive messages or sound cues from the framework
- You won’t be able to interact or reveal enemy positions

---

## 🪖 Rally System

Rally points act as **team respawn hubs** placed by squad leaders or medics.

- A rally flag will appear in the field (often with a smoke marker)
- You can respawn here if it’s active
- If enemies get too close, the rally will **collapse**
- Rallies often have **limited respawns or cooldowns**

> Stick with your team and communicate — your rally may be the only way back to the front line!


---

## 🎧 Earplugs

You can insert/remove earplugs via:
- The **ACE self-interaction menu**
- Or a bound key (if enabled in mission settings)

Earplugs:
- Reduce loud gunfire and explosion volume
- Help you stay aware during prolonged firefights
- Can be toggled on/off at any time

---

## 📦 Supply Crates

You’ll find ammo, grenades, and equipment in marked supply crates.

- Crates may be static, vehicle-based, or spawned by the mission
- Crates are categorized by type (e.g., **Ammo**, **Medical**)
- Contents are dynamically generated based on the mission’s needs

---

## 🩹 Medical Stations

Some missions include **medical stations** that:
- Heal unconscious players
- Replenish your medical supplies
- Act as safe respawn points

Look for tents, boxes, or medic-marked vehicles.

---

## ✅ Framework Behavior Tips

- The framework **does not interfere with core ACE mechanics**, but may modify respawn/spectator behavior
- Some missions may include **custom sound cues, visual effects**, or messages via the framework
- When in doubt, ask your squad leader — they may have additional tools available via framework systems

---

## 🧭 Final Advice

Play like you’re part of the world:
- Use your tools, listen to cues, and rely on your squad
- Not every death is final — but every decision matters

Have fun, fight smart, and enjoy the mission!
