# 🎮 Player Guide

Welcome to **Mission Framework** player guide.  
This page explains how the framework’s systems function during gameplay, so you know what to expect when playing a mission that uses it.

No setup required — just play, learn, and adapt.

## 🔁 Respawn System

The framework is built around there being a singular "spawn zone" - this is where you will spawn no matter what. Your mission-maker might have this be a detailed FOB, with several options for your reinsertion into the mission, or it may just be a basic room with an option to teleport back into the fight somewhere.

If you die, you may:
- Respawn at the designated spawn zone
- Enter spectator mode while awaiting respawn if **permadeath** is enabled

> {% callout info %}
> Respawn options depend on the mission — some may have **limited lives** or require team medics to revive you.
> {% endcallout %}

## 💀 Unconsciousness & Spectator View

If you're critically wounded:
- You'll enter an **unconscious state** where you can’t move or speak
- You may hear muffled audio or a “heartbeat” effect
- If **not revived**, you'll **bleed out** and either die or become a spectator

While spectating:
- You may only see your body, or a limited first-person view
- You may receive messages or sound cues from the framework
- You won’t be able to interact or reveal enemy positions

---

## 🪖 Rally System

Rally points act as **team respawn hubs** placed by squad leaders or medics.

- A rally flag will appear in the field (often with a smoke marker)
- You can respawn here if it’s active
- If enemies get too close, the rally will **collapse**
- Rallies often have **limited respawns or cooldowns**

> {% callout tip %}
> Stick with your team and communicate — your rally may be the only way back to the front line!
> {% endcallout %}

---

## 🎧 Earplugs

You can insert/remove earplugs via:
- The **ACE self-interaction menu**
- Or a bound key (if enabled in mission settings)

Earplugs:
- Reduce loud gunfire and explosion volume
- Help you stay aware during prolonged firefights
- Can be toggled on/off at any time

---

## 📦 Supply Crates

You’ll find ammo, grenades, and equipment in marked supply crates.

- Crates may be static, vehicle-based, or spawned by the mission
- Crates are categorized by type (e.g., **Ammo**, **Medical**)
- Contents are dynamically generated based on the mission’s needs

---

## 🩹 Medical Stations

Some missions include **medical stations** that:
- Heal unconscious players
- Replenish your medical supplies
- Act as safe respawn points

Look for tents, boxes, or medic-marked vehicles.

---

## ✅ Framework Behavior Tips

- The framework **does not interfere with core ACE mechanics**, but may modify respawn/spectator behavior
- Some missions may include **custom sound cues, visual effects**, or messages via the framework
- When in doubt, ask your squad leader — they may have additional tools available via framework systems

---

## 🧭 Final Advice

Play like you’re part of the world:
- Use your tools, listen to cues, and rely on your squad
- Not every death is final — but every decision matters

Have fun, fight smart, and enjoy the mission!
