# Platoon Rally System

*Adds a rally point system that allows players to teleport to and from squad-level and platoon-level rally points*

---

## ‚úÖ Purpose

This system gives players an immersive way to get back into the action by travelling to and from spawn to a system of rally points.


---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The framework assumes there is a consistent "home spawn" where players will respawn. At this "home spawn", there is an interactable object that will allow players to travel to either the platoon rally, one of the squad rallies, or travel directly to a squadmate.

A <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Platoon Rally</span> can be placed by any player who is designated as a Platoon Leader.

a <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Squad Rally</span> can be placed by any player who is designated as a Squad Leader.

The ability to teleport to a rally point or squadmate can be enabled or disabled by the mission-maker before or during the mission.

- The teleport to rally or squadmate actions are given as scroll wheel actions in the interactable object at base.
- Teleport to squadmate will teleport the player to a randomly selected teammate. If they are in a vehicle, the player will be teleported into an available passenger seat.
- Players can teleport back to base from the Platoon Rally via an interaction labelled `Retreat`.
- Teleporting to the Rally Point or to a squadmate will be blocked if enemies are nearby.

## üõ†Ô∏è Mission Maker Usage

The Rally Point system can be enabled in <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">JM_init.sqf</span> by toggling `JM_Rally` to true.

The Framework Composition contains a prebuilt rally system with all of the objects and respective init box code.

To designate a specific player as either a Platoon Leader or Squad Leader, place the following code in that slots init box:

SQUAD LEADER: `this setVariable ["JM_isSquadLead", true];`

PLATOON LEADER: `this setVariable ["JM_isPlatoonLead", true];`

There is no limit to the number of Platoon Leaders/Squad Leaders, but limiting the number is recommended as Rally Point spawning can be very powerful...

There are zeus modules in the framework that allow the enabling or disabling of teleporting to either the rally points OR to squadmates. There is also a module that allows Zeus to assign/unassign the SL/PL roles to players mid-mission (useful for disconnects and reshuffling of the team unexpectedly).

## üß™ Notes & Tips

- The system assumes that players will always respawn on the "respawn_west" (or equivalent) spawn point. This is where you can place your interactable objects. The base can be an entire FOB, or a 2x2 room if players aren't supposed to explore anywhere.
- Teleporting straight to a squadmate is very powerful. It is obviously very fast, but the trade-off is that you are thrown into the action, with all the consequences good and bad.
