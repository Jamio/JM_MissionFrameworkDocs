# Grasscutter

*Adds an ACE interaction to all players that allows them to clear an area of grass.*

---

## ✅ Purpose

This system gives players an immersive way to simulate clearing ground brush. This can be useful allowing marksmen, or prepared defensive positions to clear proper lines of sight to areas without blades of grass being right in front of their scopes..


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

If the system is enabled by the mission-maker, all players will recieve an ACE interaction under `Equipment` that will allow them to clear grass from the ground.

- Players using the grasscutter will perform an animation.
- Interrupting the progress bar whilst cutting will stop the cutter from deploying.

## 🛠️ Mission Maker Usage

The Grasscutter can be enabled in <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">JM_init.sqf</span> by toggling `JM_GrassCutter` to true.
