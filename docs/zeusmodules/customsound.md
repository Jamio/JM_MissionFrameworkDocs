# Custom Sound

*Plays a custom sound in 3D space.*

---

## ✅ Purpose

This system gives you a handy way of playing custom sounds in 3D space.

Currently, if you want to play sounds through the PlaySound vanilla module, you have to patch them into the game. This system bypasses that, keeping it all confined to scripts and mission files.


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When the module is placed, a dialog will prompt you to select the sound, distance and volume.

- The module will pull all mission sounds - this means any you have defined in CfgSounds.

## 🧪 Notes & Tips

- This module is designed to be compatible with Crows Electronic Warfare, which also contains a nifty playSound module. This module will not appear if Crows EW is loaded, and will instead add your custom sounds to that mods list of sounds.
