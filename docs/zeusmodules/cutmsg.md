# Cutaway Message

*Blacks out all players screens, and displays a custom text message in the centre of the screen.*

---

## ✅ Purpose

This module gives you a way to display text on players' screens, alongside blocking their view.

This could be good for transitional stages of your mission i.e if you wanted to change the weather, you could block players' screens and mess around with it in Zeus...


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Placing the module will open a dialog, in which you can edit the text, duration and whether the cutaway will affect Zeus players.
