# Countdown Timer

*Displays a hint-based countdown timer for all players.*

---

## ✅ Purpose

This system is designed as an alternative to the vanilla countdown timer, that automatically ends the mission upon completion.

This module will display a timer for all players, with custom messaging during and after the timer has completed.


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Placing the module will open a dialog that will allow you to customise the countdown message, completion message, and time.

- The hint will update every second.

## 🧪 Notes & Tips

- Because this hint updates every second, and broadcasts to all players, I would recommend using this in non-critical moments of your mission. The timer hint will obviously overwrite other hints, so if you set the timer for 30 minutes, you are effectively blocking other hints for 30 minutes. Not game-breaking, but potentially not great.
