# AWACS Report

*A simple module to simulate BRAA calls from an AWACS.*

---

## ✅ Purpose

This system is designed for missions with Air-to-Air combat, and dynamically allows the zeus to simulate an AWACS in the AO.


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When the module is placed, a dialog will prompt you to configure the specifics of the BRAA call.

Pressing confirm will broadcast the AWACS BRAA call to all players, via a hint.
